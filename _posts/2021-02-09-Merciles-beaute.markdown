Books are the most pleasant thing that you can buy when you are a student with not enough money. Last week, I bought a poetry book. It is a great book. Here I would like to write about the first poem of the book and also write about its meaning. The poem is written by Geoffrey Chaucer (1340~1344 to 1400). This is the poem.



A Triple Roundel


I. Captivity

Your yën two wol sle me sodenly,     
I may the beaute of hem not sustene,     
So woundeth hit through-out my herte kene.

And but your word wol helen hastily   
My hertes wounde, whyl that hit is grene,   
Your yën two wol sle me sodenly;    
may the beaute of hem not sustene.

Upon my trouthe I sey yow feithfully,   
That ye ben of my lyf and deth the quene;   
For with my deth the trouthe shal be sene.   
Your yën two wol sle me sodenly,   
I may the beaute of hem not sustene,   
So woundeth hit through-out my herte kene.   



II. Rejection.

So hath your beaute fro your herte chaced   
Pitee, that me ne availeth not to pleyne;   
For Daunger halt your mercy in his cheyne.   

Giltles my deth thus han ye me purchaced;   
I sey yow soth, me nedeth not to feyne;   
     So hath your beaute fro your herle chaced   
     Pilee, that me ne availeth not to pleyne   

Allas! that nature hath in yow compassed   
So gret beaute, that no man may atteyne   
To mercy, though he sterve for the peyne.   
     So hath your beaute fro your herte chaced   
     Pitee, that me ne availeth not to pleyne;   
     For daunger halt your mercy in his cheyne.   



III. Escape.

Sin I fro love escaped am so fat,   
I never thenk to ben in his prison lene;   
Sin I am fre, I counte him not a bene.   

He may answere, and seye this or that;   
I do no fors, I speke right as I mene.   
     Sin I fro love escaped am so fat,   
     I never thenk to ben in his prison lene.   

Love hath my name y-strike out of his sclat,   
And he is strike out of my bokes clene   
For ever-mo; [ther] is non other mene.   
     Sin I fro love escaped am so fat,   
     I never thenk to ben in his prison lene;   
     Sin I am fre, I counte him not a bene.   

The poem is not easy to read and understand. Many spellings have changed over time and also by different editors. This version seemed to be a good one to read. However, it is not easy to understand. [Here](https://reflection.eleusinianm.co.uk/medieval-literature/yellow-book-of-calbourne/merciless-beauty) you can find a reasonable translation. Basically, the poet is talking about love and its pain when she is not there. I found the feeling and the challenges of the poet in this poem an interesting and common thing in all ages. And I believe the poet is describing it in a beautiful way. In any case, you can read it and record it, I would be glad to listen to you! So please share it!
