He was a kind man. Super talented. He was so polite and nice. I can't name a single person that had any conflict with him. He was my high school friend. I have so many nice memories with him. But yesterday he passed away. He was  dealing with cancer for a long time and now he has eternal peace. He never chose anything but spade as the hokm. Kind man. I hope you rest in peace. We will never forget you.
