It was one beautiful winter day that I realized I want to adopt a cat. It was a good decision for both Morgoth and me.
Searching for a cat on shelter websites was not successful. Many calls and emails lead me to nothing but disappointment. Someone suggested looking on
the marketplaats. That is a dark place with some good people in it. Watching crazy ads from breeders was not easy. After a week of searching and receiving rejections, I receive a message from a guy who wanted me to meet the cat. They were a family that wanted to find a new house for their beloved cat because of allergy issues. They were in the northern parts of the Netherlands. So I bought a piece of luggage and took the train to the north.

I took the train to Utrecht. I had to change my train to that station. Apparently, the train was much shorter than the station and I missed it. I had to wait for one hour for the next one. It was a nice passing of time.

The trees and nature of that area were different from where I currently live. It seemed like a colder place. But that day was sunny and pleasant. I was reading a sad book, one thousand paper cranes. I didn't feel the passage of time. I arrived in Apeldoorn.

The city was small and beautiful. People were walking and the sun was shining. It was a beautiful day and I was so so excited. After 10 minutes of walking in the city, I arrived at the address.

They were a family of 3. A lovely and kind couple and their 2 months old son. It was so painful for them to say goodbye to the cat. I promised them to send them pictures every now and then. They also offered to drive me back home. Kind family. After a short talk, I took the cat and left. Named him Mandos. He was so unhappy to leave. Yelling the whole way back to the train station. When he saw there is no way back, he stopped meowing and remained silent.

We arrived home. He wasn't eager to get out of the luggage. He was unhappy and afraid. I took him out and soon after he found a spot under my bed to hide. Happily, the previous family accepted to bring his old stuff to Eindhoven. It would help him to feel better much faster. I put water and food for him. He came out when I shut off the light. Walking around the room to discover the new place. This cat is not like Morgoth at all. The first day Morgoth arrived, he started discovering the whole house. But eventually, he started to get better. Now he is a lovely and spoiled cat. This is the cat that Giti always wanted. And Morgoth is the cat I always wanted. But due to emotional reasons, Mandos will live with me. Everyone says he is like a character. I don't think so. Dominika, my roommate, is also very kind and gentle with Mandos and it makes me happy. So yes. That's the story of Mandos. Here are two pictures.
