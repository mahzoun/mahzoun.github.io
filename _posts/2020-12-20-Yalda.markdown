According to the Wikipedia, [Yaldā Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yald%C4%81_Night) (Persian: شب یلدا‎ shab-e yalda) or Chelleh Night (Persian: شب چله‎ shab-e chelle) is an Iranian festival celebrated on the "longest and darkest night of the year". For me, probably like most of Iranian people, this night is the second most important Persian festival. People usually celebrate it by visiting family, reading poetry, eating, and socializing. We also celebrate it with friends. However, it happened to be a virtual gathering this year. (I lived in a time where people avoid each other due to the COVID19). I will write about my 2019 Yalda and 2020 Yalda.      
In 2019, we were a bunch of masters students. It was the hard days of exams. The Party was at my room. Friends of mine came to my room. I was preparing the special edition of "Salad Olvie". I believe people should add Feta cheese. Everyone else says there is no Feta cheese in the recipe. But believe me, feta cheese is a game changer. While I was preparing the meal, guys arrived. They brought snacks and fruits. The most important fruit for Yalda night is Pomegranate (and watermelon but I am allergic so screw it). We played music, preparing the fruits and food and talked and laughed.

The breads are amazing french baguettes. The plates are my special edition "Olvie". And delicious fruits! We talked until late night. We read Poetry and we did Fortune-telling. We slept and in the next morning, we went to pere la chaise. We visited Sadegh Hedayat, Chopin and we again read poetry! Although we read dark poetry of winter and death.

Days passed. Hard they were. We were five friends living in Paris. After a year, each of us was living in a different place. Mahoor moved to Germany. Benyamin, after moving to Austria to work on his thesis, moved to Switzerland. Giti stayed in Paris to start her PhD, Shaker returned to Iran for his studies, and I moved to Netherlands. We were planning to have a party for 2020 too. The first plan was a party in my house in Netherlands. But corona was a bitch. So we did it online. Although, this year we had two newcomers. Maryam and Sadegh also joined us. Again, we made a special Olvie with Feta cheese, and prepare fruits. We had a online meeting. The program was almost same as previous year. We talked, laughed, read Poetry, and did fortune telling.
The food was same. (Well, it's a tradition! I made it!)

I was wearing the very same T-shirt!

And we had a special guest! Morgoth!

Around midnight, each of us went to the closest river with a poetry book. We sat there, in the misty night, reading poetry!

And 2020 Yalda was also over. We are in the last days of 2020. The end of December. Who knows what will happen next year. I only hope to have this people around me again for the next year. Happy and Healthy!
